This is for 9th grade project where we have to create something that helps our community. The goal is to move a bowl similar to a microwave bowl around to face the sun / heat source cooking the food inside the bowl. This was designed to help homeless people since finding a reliable source of power / finding something to heat food up can be challenging without a home. How it works is we have a stepper motor on the bottom which moves the bowl around left or right. Using photoresistors we determine which direction the Stepper motor should go. Since the Margin / in between is 50(can be whatever just 50 for example) the diff(L-R/R-L) is greater then the Margin then the stepper motor knows which direction to go. If Diff(L-R) > Margin go left likewise for right. Feel free to suggest any upgrades to the code im open to any sorts of criticism
